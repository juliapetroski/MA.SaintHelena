	abstract = {Large Procellariiformes (albatrosses and petrels) constitute a highly threatened group of birds, for which bycatch in fisheries is the most prevalent threat. At-sea intentional killing and post-capture, handling-related injuries, remain poorly understood menaces. Here, we report fishermen off southern Brazil trying to reduce bait depredation in pole-and-line and handlining fisheries by hitting birds with a metal piece attached to a pole-and-line on four occasions. Fishermen also mutilated or killed birds caught alive on the lines (aggressive handling). In addition, we present a compilation of records of Procellariiformes with bill mutilations across the southwest Atlantic Ocean. Related to the intentional killing events, 16 birds of four species (two globally threatened) were recorded dead (n = 13) or injured (n = 3) with head trauma, broken limbs, wounds or bill mutilation. Observations spanning 1999--2019 across the waters of Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina totalize 46 Procellariiformes of eight species (four globally threatened) recorded with bill mutilations (29 alive and 17 dead). Mutilations were likely caused by aggressive handling of birds caught alive, potentially in Brazilian hook-and-line fisheries or in demersal and pelagic longline fisheries across the southwest Atlantic. Observations of deliberate killing from multiple vessels and the recurrent records of mutilated birds suggest those practices represent pervasive but largely undocumented threats to seabirds and could complicate the detection of fishery-related population effects. Coordinated actions by international bodies and national authorities are urgently needed to address this threat, including increasing at-sea observation, enforcement actions and campaigns targeting better handling practices among fishermen.},

	abstract = {The decline of populations of certain seabirds and sea turtles around the world is partly related to their incidental capture in large-scale fisheries. However, the impacts of small-scale fisheries on endangered seabirds and sea turtles, being carried out in many places around the world, have been largely neglected by scientists and governments. We monitored 178 fishing days and described a range of poorly known hook-and-line commercial fisheries carried out by the Itaipava fleet, southeastern Brazil, composed by 497 vessels and deploying hooks from 18$\,^{\circ}$S to 35$\,^{\circ}$S. Seven fisheries were defined: fast trolling for tuna and tuna-like species, slow trolling for Bigeye tuna, handlining, surface longline for Dolphinfish, pelagic longline for Swordfish, bottom dropline, and pole-and-line with live bait. We observed bycatch of 47 seabirds of six species and 45 turtles of four species. Capture rates were higher for the surface longline for Dolphinfish (0.15 birds/1000 hooks and 1.08 turtles/1000 hooks), slow trolling for Bigeye tuna (0.41 birds/day) and handlining targeting Yellowfin tuna (0.61 birds/day). Endangered Spectacled petrel (Procellaria conspicillata), Atlantic Yellow-nosed (Thalassarche chlororhynchos), and Black-browed (T. melanophris) albatrosses were the main seabirds caught. Immature Loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) and immature or adult Leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) were the main sea turtles affected by the surface longline for Dolphinfish. Monitoring the fleet and bycatch levels, development of mitigation measures, establishment of educational programs, government control over the fleet, and enforcement, are urgently required for the hook-and-line fisheries described in the present study.},

	abstract = {The incidental capture in fisheries is probably the main conservation problem affecting seabirds. While the capture of albatrosses and petrels on longline hooks is well-known worldwide, the bycatch of diving seabirds in gillnets is an overlooked conservation problem. During a winter coastal fishing trip, the capture of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) was recorded in driftnet and bottom setnet fisheries for the first time in southern Brazil. The highest captures rates were found in driftnets, from 146.5 to 545.5penguins/km2 of net and a total of 56 dead penguins were recorded. In the bottom gillnet, a total of 12 birds were killed and the capture rates varied from 41.7 to 125.0penguins/km2 of net. Although preliminary, the results presented in this paper were consistent between sets. If we consider the magnitude of driftnet and setnet fishing fleets, and that most dead penguins were adults, the impact upon Magellanic penguin populations is probably significant.},

@article{domiciano16,
	abstract = {Cetaceans are considered environmental sentinels and their health often reflects either anthropogenic or natural spatio-temporal disturbances. This study investigated the pathological findings and mortality of small cetaceans with the aim of detecting hazards and monitoring health trends in a high-biodiversity area. Between 2007 and 2012, 218 stranded cetaceans were recorded on the Paran{\'a} coast, southern Brazil. Fifty-seven (26.1%) of these animals, including 50 Sotalia guianensis, 2 Pontoporia blainvillei, 2 Stenella frontalis, 1 Stenella longirostris, 1 Tursiops truncatus and 1 Globicephala melas were necropsied and samples were collected for histopathology. Causes of death were determined in 46 of the 57 (80.7%) animals and most (30 or 65.2%) were ascribed to anthropogenic activities, including fisheries bycatch (28/30) and trauma (2/30). The remaining 16 fatalities were considered natural, and attributed to pneumonia (10/16), emaciation (3/16), septicemia (1/16), neonatal pathology (1/16) and choking via food obstruction (1/16). Irrespective of the cause, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, associated with parasitism, lymphadenitis and membranous glomerulonephritis were common findings among all fatalities. These results suggest, that while anthropogenic activities are a leading cause of cetacean strandings in Paran{\'a}, underlying pre-existing diseases may contribute towards deaths. Although the studied area is considered a biosphere reserve by UNESCO, complex anthropogenic and natural interactions might be occurring, increasing cetacean susceptibility to hazards. This study may help facilitate developing an effective conservation plan for coastal cetaceans focusing on reducing fisheries interactions, habitat degradation and pollution as mechanisms for ultimately increasing species resilience.},

@article{prado21,
	abstract = {Abstract Franciscana dolphin Pontoporia blainvillei bycatch has been high for near six decades in western South Atlantic, with large regional variation. In 2012, the Brazilian Government-regulated gillnet fisheries in south and southeast Brazil by reducing fishing effort and establishing no-fishing zones. However, there is evidence that the magnitude of franciscana bycatch remains high and unsustainable. The aims of this study were to identify hotspot areas of franciscana bycatch associated with two main gillnet fisheries and to propose no-fishing zones combined with limited total allowable fishing effort (i.e. total net length per season) in order to meet management objectives in southern Brazil. A hierarchical Bayesian model using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) was employed based on 1427 reported settings from 1999 to 2003 and 2006 to 2009. Hotspot zones were detected and are proposed as no-fishing zone during the white croaker Micropogonias furnieri and striped weakfish Cynoscion guatucupa gillnet fishing seasons. Their extents represent 6\% (1466.8 km2) and 19\% (4493.7 km2) of the fishing ground (23 204.1 km2) during croaker and weakfish fishing seasons respectively. The total allowable fishing effort estimated outside the no-fishing zones were estimated at 541 km (95\% credible interval (CrI) [339; 940]) during croaker and 688 km (CrI [312; 2,166]) during weakfish fishing seasons, one order of magnitude lower than the current total fishing effort. The drastic reduction of total fishing effort estimated in this study is largely due to weak protection measures since the gillnet fisheries became the major conservation concern for franciscana by the end of 1970s in southern Brazil. Although the implementation of the proposed exclusion zones and limiting fishing effort will strongly impact the status quo, they were based on the best scientific evidence and on a clearly defined management goal to reduce the risk of the franciscana population's collapse in southern Brazil.},

	abstractnote = {Bycatch of franciscanas in fishing operations along the western South Atlantic Ocean has been observed for approximately 60 years. Reports on bycatch in shark gillnet fisheries off Uruguay date back to the early 1940s. A decade later, gillnet fisheries for bottom-dwelling fish became the major conservation concern for franciscanas in both Brazil and Argentina. A small portion (c. 10%), of the coastal gillnet fleet which operate from the port of Rio Grande (southern Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil) was monitored in 1999-2000. The total annual bycatch was estimated to be 946 franciscanas (non-parametric CI = 467 - 1525) for the year 1999 and 719 (non-parametric CI = CI: 248 - 1413) dolphins for 2000. The total bycatch for the whole FMA III was 1106 (CI: 578 - 1915) for 1999 and 992 (CI: 475 - 1832) for 2000. Since data were not normally distributed confidence intervals were estimated by non-parametric bootstrap. Despite strong evidence of decline for the stock from FMA III, no mitigation strategy has been established or designed. Instead, fishing effort is still very high, it is increasing and bycatch is uncontrolled. Thus, prompt management action is required. Regulation of gillnet fishing effort might be the only suitable immediate action to mitigate the bycatch.},

	abstract = {Abstract Bycatch in gillnet fisheries is one of the main threats to several penguin species. Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) are caught by gillnets during their wintering in southern Brazil. However, current information is based only on a small number of sets observed during a single fishing trip. This study assesses bycatch rates of bottom and drift gillnets operating in southern Brazil, and describes the sex and age classes of individuals captured. In 80 bottom gillnet sets, 33 penguins were captured (85\% adults), 14 were sexed of which 13 were females. In 41 drift gillnet sets, four penguins were captured, three of which were juveniles. The mean bycatch rates, measured as number of penguins km−2 of net and number of penguins km−2 h−1, were significantly higher for the drift gillnets. Despite the lower bycatch rates, owing to the higher fishing effort in terms of number of boats, net length, net area, soak time and fishing season, the magnitude of penguin bycatch in the bottom gillnet fishery cannot be ignored. Despite based on small sample size, the predominance of adult and female Magellanic penguins as bycatch in gillnet fisheries in southern Brazil agrees with previous studies suggesting that females displace further north than males. In addition, such evidence contributes to the male-biased sex ratio in breeding grounds, and the long-term decline of major Patagonian colonies owing to higher female mortality during winter.},

	abstract = {Tropical and subtropical shrimp fisheries occur mainly nearshore, where numerous non-target species (bycatch) are captured. Bycatch is a serious issue for fishing activity and understanding its impacts through integrative analyses of the bycatch structure is necessary. In Brazil, information on bycatch composition and structure is limited. As such, we conducted a study on the target species and bycatch communities from a fishery area in the southern Brazilian coast, considering a 20-year dataset. The target species abundance was influenced by seasonal conditions, where peaks of abundance occurred from February to May and August to October. The trawl captures comprised 149 species, of which 116 species were discarded and 33 were considered usable by the fishermen. The bycatch composition had few abundant and several rare species, with a high bycatch rate associated with salinity and TSS, mainly in the latter years of study. Bycatch diversity showed association with salinity, and multiyear oscillations, but generally maintained a stable trend over years. Our analysis revealed bycatch patterns and the influence of environmental variables in a single ecosystem. In the context of scarce data and an incipient management structure, these findings are crucial to develop a coherent approach for fisheries management.},

	abstract = {{In response to concerns over wastage and negative impacts on stocks, the damage (antennae loss) and collateral mortality of artisanally trawled-and-discarded juvenile seabob shrimp (Xiphopenaeus kroyeri) and the key factors explaining variability were assessed in the South Brazil Bight. During 20 deployments across 7 d of fishing, 1562 X. kroyeri (14.5 $\pm$ 3.1 mm carapace length, CL) were discarded into replicate on-board tanks at both the start and end of sorting, with some individuals monitored immediately for antennae loss and mortalities, and the rest assessed after 3 h. Virtually, all X. kroyeri discarded towards the end of sorting (mean $\pm$ SD air exposure of 15.9 $\pm$ 3.9 min) died. By comparison, those discarded at the start (2.7 $\pm$ 2.8 min) had variable temporal mortalities (total of 52.3\\% immediately vs. 66.2\\% after 3 h) which, like antennae loss (total mean $\pm$ SE of 50.4 $\pm$ 34.2\\%) were positively associated with haul duration/catch weight and deck exposure, and more frequent among individuals with soft than hard exoskeletons. Antennae loss was also negatively correlated with CL. The results support (i) improving trawl selectivity to reduce the catches of small, unwanted X. kroyeri and other bycatch (and therefore total weights of catches) and/or (ii) sorting catches in water (to minimize air exposure). Such modifications might be promoted through awareness of the potential harvest benefits to fishers associated with reducing unaccounted fishing mortality of the targeted species.}},

	abstract = {Ecosystem effects of recent changes in fishing strategies in the South Brazil Bight (SBB) area, including increasing squid catches by shrimp bottom trawlers and fishing for young sardines as bait, for the skipjack tuna pole-and-line fishery were investigated by modelling the SBB coastal ecosystem for the 1998--1999 fisheries period, using the mass-balance modelling software, Ecopath with Ecosim. Based on fisheries information and on previous models, 25 species groups were defined. The mean trophic level of all fisheries was 2.99 with small trawlers and the live baitfish fleet occupying the lowest trophic levels. The change in squid fishing rate and the most important squid predators fishing rate were simulated by increasing fishing mortality (F) from 0 to 1 per year, while maintaining F constant for other exploited groups. Also, the impact of fishing pressure by trawlers on squids and by the live baitfish fleet on young sardines were simulated. Different hypotheses of flow control were tested by setting the maximum instantaneous mortality rate that consumers could exert on food resources by (a) ``top-down'' control by predators (predator control); (b) all interactions of mixed control type; and (c) ``bottom-up'' control of predators by their prey (donor control). For squid, predicted biomass changes were more pronounced under top-down control that under bottom-up. Biomass of the weakfish, which are important squid predators, were the most affected under all hypotheses. A similar pattern of decrease in other squid predators was seen. The ecosystem consequence of overexploiting weakfish and large pelagic fish biomass was speculated regarding the increasing squid catches. Simulations of increasing live-baitfish fleet did not show prominent impact in the inner shelf, where present F values are low. Given young sardines concentrate in shallow waters, where the conflicts converge, a complementary model of the adjacent coastal system and artisanal fisheries could better address fleet's impact. Nevertheless, it was noted a decrease of sharks and rays reflecting their vulnerability in the system. A precautionary measure for fisheries management in the region would be to assume that top-down control is a dominant force in energy flows, differing from the custom emphasis placed only in environmental forces and productivity. The ecosystem approach will require the integration of information from a wide range of disciplines, levels of ecological organization and temporal and spatial scales, as well as concrete management measures.},

	abstract = {Landing data are the most basic information used to manage fisheries, although they are often unavailable or incomplete. The objective of this work was to reconstruct the national database of marine commercial landings for the Brazilian industrial and artisanal fisheries, from 1950 to 2015. Total landings increased strongly from 1950 to mid-1980s and suffered sharp decline in the early 1990s, mainly associated to the collapse of sardine fisheries. After that, another period of increasing landings was observed, but at a much lower rate. Industrial landings always surpassed artisanal landings in Brazilian waters, except for the beginning of the time series, when many industrial fleets had not started yet, and in the early 2000s, when a change in the methodology for collecting landing statistics was implemented in the state of Par{\'a} leading to an overestimation of artisanal landings. Artisanal fisheries have been declining since 2005, which is worrisome due to the social impact it may have on local income and food security. Regional differences were also observed, with industrial landings being always higher than artisanal landings in southeastern-southern Brazil, while the opposite was true for the northern-northeastern regions. Higher landings were observed in the southeastern-southern regions when both artisanal and industrial fleets were combined. Sardine and demersal fishes were the main resources landed by industrial fishers. Artisanal fishers caught more species than their industrial counterpart, featuring Xiphopenaeus kroyeri, Cynoscion acoupa, and Ucides cordatus. Although the fishing of Epinephelus itajara was banned in Brazil, it continues to be landed. Yet, catches of this species and others under some threat status are still not properly registered, including: Carcharhinus longimanus, Galeorhinus galeus, Sphyrna lewini, Sphyrna mokarran, Pristis pectinata, and Pseudobatos horkelii. Fishing resources not identified in previous landing reconstruction efforts, such as sea urchins and sea cucumbers, have now been reported. The database presented here should be continuously updated and improved. It is of paramount importance to resume the collection of landing statistics, including information on fishing effort, to assess the relative impact of fisheries and environmental factors on the main Brazilian fishing stocks.},

@article{bornatowski18,
	abstract = {Large pelagic predators occupy high positions in food webs and could control lower trophic level species by direct and indirect ecological interactions. In this study we aimed to test the hypotheses: (1) pelagic predators are keystone species, and their removals could trigger impacts on the food chain; (2) higher landings of pelagic predators could trigger fishing impacts with time leading to a drop in the mean trophic level of catches; and (3) recovery in the pelagic predators populations, especially for sharks, could be achieved with fishing effort reduction. We performed a food web approach using an Ecopath with Ecosim model to represent the Southeastern and Southern Brazil, a subtropical marine ecosystem, in 2001. We then calibrated the baseline model using catch and fishing effort time series from 2001 to 2012. Afterwards, we simulated the impact of fishing effort changes on species and assessed the ecological impacts on the pelagic community from 2012 to 2025. Results showed that the model was well fitted to landing data for the majority of groups. The pelagic predators species were classified as keystone species impacting mainly on pelagic community. The ecosystem was resilient and fisheries seem sustainable at that time. However, the temporal simulation, from 2001 to 2012, revealed declines in the biomass of three sharks, tuna and billfish groups. It was possible observe declines in the mean trophic level of the catch and in the mean total length of landings. Longline fisheries particularly affected the sharks, billfish and swordfish, while hammerhead sharks were mostly impacted by gillnet fishery. Model simulations showed that large sharks'biomasses could be recovered or maintained only after strong fishing effort reduction.},

	abstract = {Skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) is one of the world's main fisheries resources. In Brazil, it is the most abundant tuna and sustains an important pole-and-line fishery in the southwest Atlantic. We systematically monitored landings of the pole-and-line fleet from January 2014 to May 2016 on fishing ports in Niter{\'o}i (RJ) to evaluate the size structure of the catches, identify species reproductive patterns and to estimate growth, recruitment and mortality parameters on the southeastern Brazilian coast. Captured specimens of K. pelamis (n = 5650) ranged from 36.5 to 84.7 cm (fork length-FL, mean = 52.0 cm $\pm$ 7.0) and from 0.9 to 15.3 kg (total weight-TW, mean = 3.1 kg $\pm$ 1.6). There was a modal progression of sizes throughout the austral seasons, with smallest individuals entering in the spring, and larger individuals in the fall. The sex ratio was 1:1 (M:F), and reproductive indices indicated a period of greater reproductive activity between the spring and early summer, with spawning peaks in January. The length at maturity was estimated at 45.6 cm FL. The estimated von Bertalanffy growth parameters were L∞ = 90.1 cm; k = 0.24 year−1; t0 = −0.54. Recruitment into the fishery occurs between 2 and 3 years of age. The total mortality, fishing mortality, natural mortality and exploitation rate were estimated at 1.42 year−1, 0.95 year−1, 0.47 year-1 and 0.67, respectively. Our results demonstrate changes in population parameters of skipjack tuna captured in southeastern Brazil. The reduction in the size structure of the fisheries, anticipation of length of first sexual maturation, small increase in the growth rate and the 30% increase in the exploitation rate indicate that, after 30 years of intense fishing activity, the Western Atlantic stock is under a high fishing pressure and must be monitored closely.},

Brazilian sardine (Sardinella brasiliensis Steindachner, 1879) spawning and nursery habitats: spatial-scale partitioning and multiscale relationships with thermohaline descriptors. -- ICES Journal of Marine Science, 69: 939--952.We provide a detailed account of the spatial structure of the Brazilian sardine (Sardinella brasiliensis) spawning and nursery habitats, using ichthyoplankton data from nine surveys (1976--1993) covering the Southeastern Brazilian Bight (SBB). The spatial variability of sardine eggs and larvae was partitioned into predefined spatial-scale classes (broad scale, 200--500 km; medium scale, 50--100 km; and local scale, \\&lt;50 km). The relationship between density distributions at both developmental stages and environmental descriptors (temperature and salinity) was also explored within these spatial scales. Spatial distributions of sardine eggs were mostly structured on medium and local scales, while larvae were characterized by broad- and medium-scale distributions. Broad- and medium-scale surface temperatures were positively correlated with sardine densities, for both developmental stages. Correlations with salinity were predominantly negative and concentrated on a medium scale. Broad-scale structuring might be explained by mesoscale processes, such as pulsing upwelling events and Brazil Current meandering at the northern portion of the SBB, while medium-scale relationships may be associated with local estuarine outflows. The results indicate that processes favouring vertical stability might regulate the spatial extensions of suitable spawning and nursery habitats for the Brazilian sardine.}},
