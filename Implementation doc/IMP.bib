	abstract = {The modeling of mid-trophic organisms of the pelagic ecosystem is a critical step in linking the coupled physical--biogeochemical models to population dynamics of large pelagic predators. Here, we provide an example of a modeling approach with definitions of several pelagic mid-trophic functional groups. This application includes six different groups characterized by their vertical behavior, i.e., occurrence of diel migration between epipelagic, mesopelagic and bathypelagic layers. Parameterization of the dynamics of these components is based on a temperature-linked time development relationship. Estimated parameters of this relationship are close to those predicted by a model based on a theoretical description of the allocation of metabolic energy at the cellular level, and that predicts a species metabolic rate in terms of its body mass and temperature. Then, a simple energy transfer from primary production is used, justified by the existence of constant slopes in log--log biomass size spectrum relationships. Recruitment, ageing, mortality and passive transport with horizontal currents, taking into account vertical behavior of organisms, are modeled by a system of advection--diffusion-reaction equations. Temperature and currents averaged in each vertical layer are provided independently by an Ocean General Circulation Model and used to drive the mid-trophic level (MTL) model. Simulation outputs are presented for the tropical Pacific Ocean to illustrate how different temperature and oceanic circulation conditions result in spatial and temporal lags between regions of high primary production and regions of aggregation of mid-trophic biomass. Predicted biomasses are compared against available data. Data requirements to evaluate outputs of these types of models are discussed, as well as the prospects that they offer both for ecosystem models of lower and upper trophic levels.},

@article{seapodym1,
	abstract = {An enhanced version of the spatial ecosystem and population dynamics model SEAPODYM is presented to describe spatial dynamics of tuna and tuna-like species in the Pacific Ocean at monthly resolution over 1$\,^{\circ}$ grid-boxes. The simulations are driven by a bio-physical environment predicted from a coupled ocean physical--biogeochemical model. This new version of SEAPODYM includes expanded definitions of habitat indices, movements, and natural mortality based on empirical evidences. A thermal habitat of tuna species is derived from an individual heat budget model. The feeding habitat is computed according to the accessibility of tuna predator cohorts to different vertically migrating and non-migrating micronekton (mid-trophic) functional groups. The spawning habitat is based on temperature and the coincidence of spawning fish with presence or absence of predators and food for larvae. The successful larval recruitment is linked to spawning stock biomass. Larvae drift with currents, while immature and adult tuna can move of their own volition, in addition to being advected by currents. A food requirement index is computed to adjust locally the natural mortality of cohorts based on food demand and accessibility to available forage components. Together these mechanisms induce bottom-up and top-down effects, and intra- (i.e. between cohorts) and inter-species interactions. The model is now fully operational for running multi-species, multi-fisheries simulations, and the structure of the model allows a validation from multiple data sources. An application with two tuna species showing different biological characteristics, skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) and bigeye (Thunnus obesus), is presented to illustrate the capacity of the model to capture many important features of spatial dynamics of these two different tuna species in the Pacific Ocean. The actual validation is presented in a companion paper describing the approach to have a rigorous mathematical parameter optimization [Senina, I., Sibert, J., Lehodey, P., 2008. Parameter estimation for basin-scale ecosystem-linked population models of large pelagic predators: application to skipjack tuna. Progress in Oceanography]. Once this evaluation and parameterization is complete, it may be possible to use the model for management of tuna stocks in the context of climate and ecosystem variability, and to investigate potential changes due to anthropogenic activities including global warming and fisheries pressures and management scenarios.},

@article{bugoni08,
	abstract = {The decline of populations of certain seabirds and sea turtles around the world is partly related to their incidental capture in large-scale fisheries. However, the impacts of small-scale fisheries on endangered seabirds and sea turtles, being carried out in many places around the world, have been largely neglected by scientists and governments. We monitored 178 fishing days and described a range of poorly known hook-and-line commercial fisheries carried out by the Itaipava fleet, southeastern Brazil, composed by 497 vessels and deploying hooks from 18$\,^{\circ}$S to 35$\,^{\circ}$S. Seven fisheries were defined: fast trolling for tuna and tuna-like species, slow trolling for Bigeye tuna, handlining, surface longline for Dolphinfish, pelagic longline for Swordfish, bottom dropline, and pole-and-line with live bait. We observed bycatch of 47 seabirds of six species and 45 turtles of four species. Capture rates were higher for the surface longline for Dolphinfish (0.15 birds/1000 hooks and 1.08 turtles/1000 hooks), slow trolling for Bigeye tuna (0.41 birds/day) and handlining targeting Yellowfin tuna (0.61 birds/day). Endangered Spectacled petrel (Procellaria conspicillata), Atlantic Yellow-nosed (Thalassarche chlororhynchos), and Black-browed (T. melanophris) albatrosses were the main seabirds caught. Immature Loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) and immature or adult Leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) were the main sea turtles affected by the surface longline for Dolphinfish. Monitoring the fleet and bycatch levels, development of mitigation measures, establishment of educational programs, government control over the fleet, and enforcement, are urgently required for the hook-and-line fisheries described in the present study.},

@article{bridges21,
	abstract = {<p>Seamounts and oceanic islands rise from the seafloor and provide suitable habitat for a diverse range of biological assemblages including Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs). Whilst they have been the focus of some work globally, there has been little description of the biological and physical environments of seamounts in the South Atlantic Ocean. In this study, we characterized benthic assemblage composition from 13 seamounts and oceanic islands spanning 8--40$\,^{\circ}$S within the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of Ascension Island, Saint Helena and Tristan da Cunha. Drop camera imagery was collected between 170 and 1000 m. All fauna present in images were identified and quantified, and multivariate statistics were used to describe biological assemblages and identify their environmental drivers. Benthic communities of temperate regions (Tristan da Cunha archipelago) were shown to be distinct from those found in the tropics, with latitude and depth identified as key environmental drivers of assemblage composition. Our results are consistent with the current understanding of the biogeography of the South Atlantic, both in terms of the distinction between tropical and temperate regions, and the influence of depth and water mass structure on assemblage distribution. Faunal assemblages are similar to those observed in the North Atlantic in terms of functional groups. VMEs are present within the EEZs of all three territories and are potentially protected from some threats by large marine protected areas (MPAs). Our imagery, data and analyses provide a baseline for south Atlantic seamounts so that future monitoring can establish whether existing protected status is sufficient to conserve both unique biodiversity and considerable potential for vital ecosystem services.</p>},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: This paper presents the first quantitative assessment of the rocky reef ecology of St Helena, a remote island in the central tropical Atlantic. Monitoring data were used to characterise different habitat types found around St Helena. These findings were compared with 9 other locations in the tropical Atlantic, in different biogeographic, oceanic and reef settings, along with the environmental variables known to limit coral reef formation. St Helenas rocky and boulder reefs had \~{}50{\%} cover dominated by turf and other filamentous algae, with lower levels of sessile invertebrates (15{\%}) and macroalgae (4{\%}). Both coral and rocky reef comparison locations also showed a dominance of turf and filamentous algae, with higher levels of macroalgae and sessile invertebrates in areas with higher nutrient concentrations (e.g. south-east continental Brazil). Coral growth in St Helena appeared to be limited by cool average sea temperatures of 22$\,^{\circ}$C, which is near, but not below, accepted lower thresholds for reef formation. The main trophic groups of fish found on rocky reefs in St Helena were comparable to other Atlantic rocky and coral reefs, with a dominance of planktivores, mobile invertivores and roving herbivores, with the major difference in trophic structure being driven by more planktivores in oceanic vs. continental versus locations. St Helenas narrow rocky coastal strip varied little in terms of reef geomorphology, resulting in high homogeneity around the island. However, endemic fish were numerous, demonstrating that isolation has produced a unique tropical Atlantic marine assemblage. },

	abstract = {<p>Marine mammal sightings were recorded during research cruises to three remote, mid-ocean British Overseas Territories in the South Atlantic and Southern Ocean. In March to April 2018 and 2019, the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) of tropical St Helena and temperate Tristan da Cunha were surveyed. The sub-polar waters of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (SGSSI) were surveyed in February to March 2019. At St Helena in 2018, five species were recorded during 11 sightings, and in 2019, four species, with one additional unidentified species, during seven sightings. Most of these sightings were of dolphin species, which are known to be resident around the Island and seamounts. In Tristan da Cunha in 2018, a total of five identified and one unidentified species were recorded during six sightings, half of which were associated with the Islands or seamounts. In 2019, due to rough weather, no sightings were recorded in the Tristan da Cunha waters. Around SGSSI, 162 sightings of 236 cetaceans were made in 2019, mostly of baleen whales, with seven species identified with certainty. Sightings around the southern South Sandwich Islands included beaked whales and large dolphins, whereas baleen whales dominated in the northern South Sandwich Islands. These results provide new data for rarely surveyed regions, helping to build a spatial picture of important areas for marine mammals, which will help inform marine spatial protection strategies.</p>},

@article{laptikhovsky21,
	abstract = {Abstract Yellowfin tuna are the mainstay of the traditional tuna fisheries in St Helena waters, but there is limited knowledge of their ecology and feeding behaviour in the area. In this study yellowfin tuna stomach contents were used to assess spatio-temporal changes in feeding strategy and consider the role of tuna in the local ecosystem. Comparisons of the feeding spectra of yellowfin tuna between inshore regions of St Helena and oceanic seamounts demonstrated that in both areas the species was largely piscivorous. In inshore waters yellowfin consumed more neritic fauna, including significant numbers of crab megalopa, whereas around seamounts the diet included a greater diversity of epi- and mesopelagic fish and squids. The most important fish prey species in inshore waters was the St Helena butterflyfish Chaetodon sanctahelenae, and around seamounts was the pufferfish Lagocephalus lagocephalus. Results indicate that the diet spectrum of yellowfin tuna in St Helena waters is relatively similar to those of conspecifics living in waters with relatively low productivity, with strategies indicative of food-poor ecosystems. The availability of coastal fauna may make areas around islands and seamounts more attractive for feeding aggregations of yellowfin tuna, compared to the open ocean. The relatively unselective feeding of yellowfin tuna means that stomachs can provide valuable data on the species diversity, particularly in remote areas with limited opportunities for dedicated research expeditions.},

@article{wright21,
	abstract = {The yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) is a widely distributed, migratory species that supports valuable commercial fisheries throughout their range. Management of migratory species requires knowledge of movement, mixing and key life history parameters such as growth rate, natural and fisheries mortality. Current management is based on the assumptions that the species is highly migratory and populations are well mixed, but these assumptions have been questioned by recent studies. Since November 2015, yellowfin tuna have been tagged with conventional, archival and pop-up satellite tags (PSAT) in the South Atlantic Ocean around St Helena, with the goal of better understanding their movement patterns and ecology in this region. Conventional tags were attached to 4049 yellowfin tuna (size range 24--158 cm fork length, FL), PSAT tags were deployed on 15 yellowfin in inshore St Helena waters (size range 95--138 cm FL) and 7 yellowfin (size range 125--140 cm FL) at Cardno Seamount, and archival tags were deployed on 48 yellowfin tuna in inshore St Helena waters (size range 69--111 cm FL). Most yellowfin tuna remained within 70 km of their release location, suggesting a degree of retention to the region. Although displacement of yellowfin was generally low, the furthest distance travelled between release and recapture location was 2755 km, with other tuna also displaying large-scale movements. Tagging revealed connections between inshore regions and seamounts, as well as links between St Helena waters and key fishing regions and putative spawning grounds in the Gulf of Guinea.},

@article{Hersbach19,
	abstract = {Abstract Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

	abstract = {Ascension, an isolated volcanic island 07$\,^{\circ}$ 57′ south of the Equator, is about 145 km west of the mid-Atlantic ridge. The position and coastal configuration of the island results in a high level of wave-action throughout. Six categories of marine habitat are distinguished: (1) open littoral rocks (igneous formations; beach rocks); (2) blow-hole areas; (3) pools (tide pools; inland saline pools); (4) turtle ponds; (5) outfall channels from power stations; (6) sublittoral substrata (rocky areas; calcareous cobbles; conch shells). Except in the absence of barnacles, the characterising organisms on wave-exposed igneous rocks are distributed much as reported elsewhere along tropical Atlantic shores, i.e.: small snails define the littoral fringe; in the eulittoral are two subzones, the upper lacking characterising organisms, the lower with lithothamnia; on the sublittoral fringe exists the sea urchin Echinometra lucunter L. Luxuriant and diversified filamentous and fleshy algae develop only where the Ascension blackfish (Melichthys niger Bloch), which are extremely abundant and widespread, can either not penetrate or not feed readily due to water movement (e.g. in inland pools; tide pools with rocky barriers; beach; rock slabs; the sublittoral in protective niches, crevices and holes). The contents of the blackfish digestive system show that algae, particularly articulated coralline algae, are widely taken by choice, necessity, or accident. Areas which are intensely grazed by fish carry prostrate or short growth forms of normally large or erect algae as a basal turf; only blue-green algae appear as unrestricted growths. Where sea urchins also are present (e.g. in the sublittoral fringe and certain tide pools) only the crustose lithothamnia persist.},

	abstract = {Little is known about colonization of remote island coasts by marine invertebrates, other than corals. The structure of hard substrata assemblages was investigated across Ascension Island's littoral zone in comparison with other sites. Arrays of acrylic panels were deployed at two sites for 2 years at Ascension Island to measure subtidal recruitment. Colonization of panels at Ascension I. was low, though space occupation, abundance and richness varied considerably. After \~{}1 and 2 years Ascension panels were {$<$}17 and {$<$}37{\%} covered by fauna and each had {$<$}22 recruits and 54 recruits (per 100 cm2) respectively, amongst the lowest density of recruits reported. Recruitment rates of corals (25 m2 year−1) at Ascension I. were also similar to the lowest levels reported elsewhere (e.g. at Bermuda or Midway islands). Less dispersive animal types, e.g. cheilostome bryozoans, were poorly represented. Panels immersed in Tanzania and Scotland were {$>$}30{\%} covered, with {$>$}76 recruits per 100 cm2 and with bryozoans well represented after 1 year. Across-littoral surveys of established macrofauna at five remote islands (Ascension I., Easter I., Azores, South Georgia and Signy I., Antarctica) revealed similar trends of a rich sublittoral and lower littoral reducing drastically up-shore; molluscs dominating abundance and species numbers, whilst polychaetes, crustaceans and echinoderms were well represented. Established sessile animals occurred patchily at a mean density of 8.26 m−2 but recruits had mortality levels {$>$}99{\%}. Polar or remote temperate/tropical sites are typically less colonized than at non-remote, low latitudes but the lowest levels reported are at remote polar sites. Reduced colonization at Ascension island reflects remoteness.},

	abstract = {Diversity patterns are determined by biogeographic, energetic, and anthropogenic factors, yet few studies have combined them into a large-scale framework in order to decouple and compare their relative effects on fish faunas. Using an empirical dataset derived from 1527 underwater visual censuses (UVC) at 18 oceanic islands (five different marine provinces), we determined the relative influence of such factors on reef fish species richness, functional dispersion, density and biomass estimated from each UVC unit. Species richness presented low variation but was high at large island sites. High functional dispersion, density, and biomass were found at islands with large local species pool and distance from nearest reef. Primary productivity positively affected fish richness, density and biomass confirming that more productive areas support larger populations, and higher biomass and richness on oceanic islands. Islands densely populated by humans had lower fish species richness and biomass reflecting anthropogenic effects. Species richness, functional dispersion, and biomass were positively related to distance from the mainland. Overall, species richness and fish density were mainly influenced by biogeographical and energetic factors, whereas functional dispersion and biomass were strongly influenced by anthropogenic factors. Our results extend previous hypotheses for different assemblage metrics estimated from empirical data and confirm the negative impact of humans on fish assemblages, highlighting the need for conservation of oceanic islands.},

	abstract = {The remarkable swarming of black triggerfish Melichthys niger (Balistidae) on oceanic islands led us to undertake a comparative ecological study of high-density and low-density populations of this unusual circumtropical species. Abundance, distribution, and aggressive encounters were recorded in the field from the high-density Johnston Atoll (JA) population, the low-density Belize (BE) population, and a local high-density aggregation from Puerto Rico (PR). JA and PR populations of M. niger occurred at significantly higher densities and were more aggregated than in BE. Intraspecific aggression (chases/min/fish) was an order of magnitude higher in BE than in JA, while interspecific aggression was similar among sites. Size frequency, growth rate, diet composition, body condition (liver-somatic index LSI) were assessed from collected specimens. JA grew more slowly than BE as determined by back-calculations from dorsal spine rings, suggesting density-dependent growth limitation. Size frequency analysis reflected this difference with significantly more large fish in the BE sample. Maximum age of triggerfish in both populations was estimated at 11 years, and 35--40{\%} of growth occurred in the first year. Diet composition was similar in all three locations and indicated broad omnivory. Percent organic composition of gut contents (food quality measure) and LSI (body condition assay) were both significantly higher in the PR population, but no difference was detected between JA and BE. An increase in consumption of algae on the degraded PR reef may explain this pattern.},

	abstract = {<p>Bathymetric features such as islands and seamounts, as well as dynamic ocean features such as fronts often harbour rich marine communities. We deployed mid-water baited remote underwater video systems on three expeditions in Ascension Island's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), surveying the waters associated with six different bathymetric and dynamic ocean features: Ascension Island, two shallow seamounts (summits ≤ 101 m), one deeper seamount (summit &gt; 250 m), apparent fronts, and haphazardly sampled open ocean areas. At Ascension Island, the pelagic assemblage consisted of a moderate proportion of predators and a diverse range of other taxa, including turtles, dolphins, and large non-piscivores. At the two shallow seamounts, sharks, tunas, billfish, and other large pelagic predators formed the vast majority of the assemblage, contributing &gt; 99.9% of biomass and &gt; 86% of abundance. At the deeper seamount, the pelagic community was comparatively depauperate, however the functional composition of its assemblage indicated some similarities to the shallow seamounts. Apparent fronts did not significantly differ from random offshore sites for metrics such as total abundance and taxonomic richness. However, they harboured assemblages with more abundant sharks, tunas, and large piscivores than random ocean open locations and these differences may be driven by certain front-associated species. Our results illustrate that pelagic assemblages vary markedly among different physical and oceanographic features and that seamounts appear particularly important for pelagic predators. The diversity and abundance of the assemblage, as well as the threatened status of many of the species observed, serve to highlight the conservation value of the Ascension Island EEZ. Our results also provide important baseline information of pelagic wildlife assemblages against which the performance of the recently implemented Ascension Island Marine Protected Area can be evaluated.</p>},

@article{weber21,
	abstract = {Elucidating the mechanisms that regulate animal populations is a fundamental goal in ecology and is increasingly important at a time of unprecedented anthropogenic disturbance to ecosystems. Here, we present direct evidence of a phenomenon known as ``Ashmole's halo'': a zone of prey depletion that is hypothesized to form around aggregations of central-place foraging predators and is believed to be the principal mechanism regulating populations of many colonially breeding animals. In effect, Ashmole's halo constitutes rare, visible evidence of the food limitation that naturally limits many predator populations and can be exacerbated by human impacts such as fisheries. Therefore, the large extent of the resource footprint we demonstrate has important implications for conservation of marine food webs at ecologically relevant scales. Colonially breeding birds and mammals form some of the largest gatherings of apex predators in the natural world and have provided model systems for studying mechanisms of population regulation in animals. According to one influential hypothesis, intense competition for food among large numbers of spatially constrained foragers should result in a zone of prey depletion surrounding such colonies, ultimately limiting their size. However, while indirect and theoretical support for this phenomenon, known as ``Ashmole's halo,'' has steadily accumulated, direct evidence remains exceptionally scarce. Using a combination of vessel-based surveys and Global Positioning System tracking, we show that pelagic seabirds breeding at the tropical island that first inspired Ashmole's hypothesis do indeed deplete their primary prey species (flying fish; Exocoetidae spp.) over a considerable area, with reduced prey density detectable \&gt;150 km from the colony. The observed prey gradient was mirrored by an opposing trend in seabird foraging effort, could not be explained by confounding environmental variability, and can be approximated using a mechanistic consumption--dispersion model, incorporating realistic rates of seabird predation and random prey dispersal. Our results provide a rare view of the resource footprint of a pelagic seabird colony and reveal how aggregations of these central-place foraging, marine top predators profoundly influence the oceans that surround them.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aim The Island Biogeography Theory (IBT) and its multiple extensions explain species diversity patterns in insular systems. However, how these theories can predict the functional diversity patterns in island systems remains challenging. Here, we evaluated the predictions of the IBT, the General Dynamic Theory of Oceanic Island Biogeography (GDM) and the Glacial-sensitive model of Island Biogeography (GSM) considering the functional diversity of reef fishes on islands. Location Tropical oceanic islands. Taxon Actinopterygii. Method We combined literature data and online repositories to gather occurrence data and traits of reef fish species for 72 tropical oceanic islands. We then calculated five functional diversity indices (functional richness `FRic', functional evenness `FEve', functional divergence `FDiv', functional over-redundancy `FOR' and functional vulnerability `FVul'). We used generalized additive mixed models to explore relationships among species richness and functional indices. Furthermore, we built Bayesian models to evaluate relationships between the functional diversity indices and several island features (isolation from the nearest reef, past and present reef area, and geological age) and two metrics that reflect the potential influence of Quaternary climatic changes (isolation from Quaternary refugia) and historical contingency (isolation from biodiversity centres). Results We observed higher levels of FRic, FDiv and FOR on the Indo-Pacific islands, whereas FEve and FVul showed higher values on the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific islands. We identified positive relationships between FRic, FDiv and FOR with species richness but negative relationships with FEve and FVul. We found that past and present reef areas best explained the variation in functional diversity among islands. Main Conclusions The functional diversity of reef fishes on oceanic islands showed a longitudinal gradient, which can be explained by differences in the evolutionary history among marine regions. Furthermore, past and present reef areas were found to be the best predictors of reef fish functional diversity on oceanic islands, extending the IBT, GDM and GSM for marine organisms within a trait-based framework.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: Spatial and temporal patterns of benthic community structure play a crucial role in shaping reef habitats and have a direct impact on fish foraging dynamics, alongside density-dependent effects on the whole community. At isolated oceanic islands, the relatively low fish species richness often leads to the hyperdominance of a few species and a general reduced trophic redundancy. However, the influence of benthic habitat features and hyperdominant species on foraging selection at oceanic islands has been largely overlooked. We used remote underwater videos (RUVs) to investigate whether reef fishes consistently forage on specific habitats across 5 different oceanic islands in the Atlantic Ocean, especially focusing on the importance of the role of hyperdominant species. We analysed 295 RUVs, within 2 m$^{2}$ areas (3-15 m deep), totalling 49 h of video. Photoquadrats were utilised to gauge benthic group coverage in the same habitats. Our results revealed 5 prevalent habitats and 6 fish trophic groups interacting with reef benthos. The intensity of feeding pressure varied across islands, depending on the diversity of habitats. Herbivores and omnivores exhibited the highest feeding pressure, with omnivores foraging on crustose coralline algae and macroalgae habitats, while herbivores primarily fed on habitats dominated by the epilithic algal matrix. Hyperdominant species forage in multiple habitats, indicating a comparatively high degree of dietary plasticity. Our findings also demonstrated that fish feeding pressure is influenced by both habitat features and fish biomass. Therefore, our study can provide valuable insights for prioritising the management of key species in isolated oceanic reefs. },

Reef fish trophic structure varies significantly across the islands, with planktivores and herbivore-detritivores showing the highest abundances in SPSPA and Ascension, while less abundant in St. Helena, aligning with the thermal gradient. Variations in reef fish community structures were predominantly influenced by thermal regimes, corroborating the expansion of species' thermal niche breadth at higher latitudes and lower temperatures.

	abstract = {The status of pinnipeds on mid-Atlantic ridge islands is reviewed to detect trends that may relate to climate change. Small numbers of southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina breed on Gough Island (40$\,^{\circ}$S, 10$\,^{\circ}$W) and at Bouvet{\o}ya (54$\,^{\circ}$24′S, 03$\,^{\circ}$21′E) where numbers remained small over \~{} 68 years. Vagrant southern elephant seals wandered farther north to tropical Saint Helena Island (15$\,^{\circ}$57′S, 5$\,^{\circ}$41′W) in historical times but have not been recorded there more recently. This suggests a contraction of their distributional range, as manifested in the decline in numbers to imminent extinction at Gough Island. At Gough Island and at Tristan da Cunha (37$\,^{\circ}$05′S, 12$\,^{\circ}$17′W), leopard seals Hydrurga leptonyx and Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella are occasional seasonal transients from Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands and the circumpolar sea ice farther to the south. Large populations of Antarctic fur seals A. gazella and sub-Antarctic fur seals A. tropicalis breed at Bouvet{\o}ya and Gough Island, respectively. The current state of both populations is uncertain as other populations of conspecifics in the South Atlantic and South Indian oceans are in decline ostensibly contingent upon reduced food availability, likely precipitated by climate change.},

The impacts on standing biomass and food webs functioning are less evident due to the paucity of data and difficulty to generate reliable models. We modeled the food web of a tropical near-pristine reef ecosystem and analyzed changes on living biomass across trophic levels as a response to ocean warming over the twenty-first century. By the end of the century, total standing biomass will decrease by 1{\%}, 8{\%} and 44{\%} under different ocean warming scenarios (from reduced RCP 2.6 emission scenario to business-as-usual RCP 8.5 scenario). As total biomass decreases, the ecosystem structure shifts favoring invertivorous fishes, suspension feeding zooplankton, and algal turfs while corals collapse. The mean trophic transfer efficiency is expected to decrease by \~{} 2{\%} between 2012 and 2100 under the RCP 8.5, while biomass residence time (mean time that a unit of biomass remains in the ecosystem) will decrease by \~{} 10{\%}. Such food web degradation can alter the dominant biomass flow jeopardizing biomass replenishment, resulting in a less productive ecosystem with increasing dependency on pelagic energy subsidies, reducing the resilience of tropical reef ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The Ascension Frigatebird is an island endemic whose conservation status was subject to confusion owing to difficulties in counting and misinterpretation of data. Accurate nest counts for this species are problematic owing to their extremely prolonged breeding seasons, high nest failure rates, turnover of individuals at nest-sites, replacement laying and biennial breeding. We conducted repeated complete censuses of Ascension Frigatebird eggs at the species' sole colony of Boatswainbird Island, and collected data on laying phenology and nest survival rates within sample quadrats, throughout the 2001 and 2002 breeding seasons. We used these data to develop an individual-based model that predicted the number of Frigatebird nests present on each day an actual census occurred assuming an arbitrary 1000 breeding females bred there. We then divided the number of nests counted in these virtual censuses by 1000 to quantify bias, and used this figure to correct real census totals. The model revealed that the population numbered c. 6250 breeding females and c. 9350 mature females in 2001--2, and that numbers have not changed significantly since the late 1950s. Productivity, at 0.34 chicks/pair, was high compared to previous studies of Ascension Frigatebirds and most of those of congeners elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Abstract Seabirds have suffered dramatic declines in population over recent decades. The most abundant seabirds of tropical oceans are Sooty Terns Onychoprion fuscatus and they have an IUCN Red List category of `Least Concern'. Ascension Island has the largest colony of Sooty Terns in the Atlantic Ocean and censuses between 1990 and 2013 have shown that its population size is static. In this study we have used historical data and recent censuses to describe the population status of Sooty Terns on Ascension Island over a century. We show that the breeding population contained over 2 million individuals in the 1870s and remained at this level for at least 70 years. However, the population declined from >2 million birds in 1942 to 350,000 birds by 1990. The population trend spanning a period equivalent to three generations of the species (63 years; 1942--2005) showed an approximate 84\% decline in population size. Using IUCN criteria this suggests that Sooty Terns on Ascension could be considered `Critically Endangered'. We conclude that a re-evaluation of Sooty Tern conservation status is necessary at the local level and possibly globally. Our study highlights that for long-lived species historic demographic data should be considered when determining conservation status.},

@article{reynolds19,
	abstract = {Abstract In the face of accelerating ecological change to the world's oceans, seabirds are some of the best bio-indicators of marine ecosystem function. However, unravelling ecological changes that pre-date modern monitoring programmes remains challenging. Using stable isotope analysis of feathers and regurgitants collected from sooty terns (Onychoprion fuscatus) nesting at a major Atlantic colony, we reconstructed a long-term dietary time series from 1890 to the present day and show that a significant dietary shift occurred during the second half of the twentieth century coinciding with an apparent population collapse of approximately 84\%. After correcting for the ``Suess Effect,'' δ13C in feathers declined by ~1.5‰ and δ15N by ~2‰ between the 1890s and the present day, indicating that birds changed their diets markedly over the period of population decline. Isotopic niches were equally wide before and after the population collapse but isotopic mixing models suggest that birds have grown ever more reliant on nutrient-poor squid and invertebrates as teleost fish have declined in availability. Given that sooty terns rely heavily on associations with sub-surface predators such as tuna to catch fish prey, the rapid expansion of industrialized fisheries for these species over the same period seems a plausible mechanism. Our results suggest that changes to marine ecosystems over the past 60 years have had a dramatic impact on the ecology of the most abundant seabird of tropical oceans, and highlight the potentially pervasive consequences of large predatory fish depletion on marine ecosystem function.},

@article{eigaard15,
	abstract = { This study assesses the seabed pressure of towed fishing gears and models the physical impact (area and depth of seabed penetration) from trip-based information of vessel size, gear type, and catch. Traditionally fishing pressures are calculated top-down by making use of large-scale statistics such as logbook data. Here, we take a different approach starting from the gear itself (design and dimensions) to estimate the physical interactions with the seabed at the level of the individual fishing operation. We defined 14 distinct towed gear groups in European waters (eight otter trawl groups, three beam trawl groups, two demersal seine groups, and one dredge group), for which we established gear ``footprints''. The footprint of a gear is defined as the relative contribution from individual larger gear components, such as trawl doors, sweeps, and groundgear, to the total area and severity of the gear's impact. An industry-based survey covering 13 countries provided the basis for estimating the relative impact-area contributions from individual gear components, whereas sediment penetration was estimated based on a literature review. For each gear group, a vessel size--gear size relationship was estimated to enable the prediction of gear footprint area and sediment penetration from vessel size. Application of these relationships with average vessel sizes and towing speeds provided hourly swept-area estimates by m{\'e}tier. Scottish seining has the largest overall gear footprint of ∼1.6 km 2 h −1 of which 0.08 km 2 has an impact at the subsurface level (sediment penetration ≥ 2 cm). Beam trawling for flatfish ranks low when comparing overall footprint size/hour but ranks substantially higher when comparing only impact at the subsurface level (0.19 km 2 h −1 ). These results have substantial implications for the definition, estimation, and monitoring of fishing pressure indicators, which are discussed in the context of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. },

	abstract = {Designation of large expanses of the ocean as Marine Protected Area (MPA) is increasingly advocated and realised. The effectiveness of such MPAs, however, requires improvements to vessel monitoring and enforcement capability. In 2014 commercial fishing was excluded from the Ascension Island Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). In 2015, through updated regulations, a licenced fishery re-opened in the northern half of the EEZ while the southern half remained closed. To assess compliance with these closures and regulations, several promising satellite technologies (Satellite Automatic Identification System (S-AIS), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) of two vessels), were trialled alongside at-sea patrols. Use of SAR enabled assessment of `dark' (non-AIS transmitting) vessels, the scope of whose activities are hardest to gauge. The high level of compliance with regulations observed, suggests the MPA may prove effective, yet a need for vigilance remains. Vessels aggregate near the EEZ border and a quarter of vessels tracked across three years exhibited S-AIS transmission gaps and present a heightened compliance risk. Use of remote, rather than local, expertise and infrastructure provide a blue-print and economies of scale for replicating monitoring across similarly sized MPAs; particularly for large (>~ 25 m) vessels with metallic superstructures conducive to SAR detection. Funding ongoing monitoring in Ascension is challenged by current levels of license uptake, which provides insufficient offsetting revenue. Satellite-derived intelligence, can be used to set risk thresholds and trigger detailed investigations. Planning long-term monitoring must, however, incorporate adequate resources for follow-up, through patrols and correspondence with flag-states and fisheries management organisations.},

@article{richardson18,
	abstract = {Abstract Since the year 2000, the designation of remote, large-scale marine protected areas (LSMPAs) has closed over 15 × 106 km2 of ocean to commercial fishing. Yet, while these mega-reserves have collectively made a major contribution toward meeting global targets for marine conservation, their effectiveness for the protection of highly mobile, pelagic species remains largely unknown. This study reports on the spatial behavior and reproductive status of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) inhabiting a proposed LSMPA around Ascension Island (tropical Atlantic), with the aim of evaluating the conservation benefits for this economically important species. Using a combination of satellite archival tags and conventional mark--recapture it was shown that individual tuna can remain within Ascension Island waters for periods of between 100 and 200 days, with core residency areas (50\% ``utilization distributions'') generally extending <200 km from shore. The vast majority of activity occurred within 92.6 km (50 nmi) of the island and coincided with a ``no-take zone'' established around the island in 2016. However, dispersive movements out of this zone were observed in some satellite-tagged individuals, possibly marking the beginning of more extensive oceanic migrations. Gonad staging of 342 individuals sampled over a 32 month period found no evidence of reproductively active (ripe) individuals, strongly suggesting that tuna foraging around Ascension Island migrate elsewhere to breed. Study results provide further evidence of the importance of oceanic islands as residency areas for pelagic megafauna, helping to justify their inclusion within LSMPAs. In the absence of local recruitment, however, these individuals will remain susceptible to exploitation on spawning grounds located outside of reserves, ultimately limiting their effectiveness and thus calling for further research to identify and protect the areas where species are most vulnerable.},

@article{orrel24,
	abstract = {Abstract Rock hind (Epinephelus adscensionis) and spotted moray (Gymnothorax moringa) are ubiquitous mesopredators that co-occur in the nearshore waters of Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean, where they have significant cultural and subsistence value, but management of their non-commercial take is limited. This isolated volcanic system is home to high biomass and low species diversity, which poses two key questions: How can two mesopredators that perform similar ecological roles coexist? And if these two species are so ecologically similar, can they be managed using the same approach? Here, we combined acoustic telemetry, stomach content analysis, and stable isotope analysis to (i) explore space use and diet choices within and between these two species and (ii) to assess appropriate species-specific management options. Although rock hind had high residency and small calculated home ranges (0.0001--0.3114 km2), spotted moray exhibited shorter periods of residency (<3 months) before exiting the array. Vertical space use differed significantly across the 20-month tracking period, with individual differences in vertical space observed for both species. A hierarchical generalized additive model using 12-h averaged depth data identified that rock hind occurred lower in the water column than spotted moray, with both species occupying moderately deeper depths at night versus day (+1.6\% relative depth). Spotted moray depth was also significantly predicted by lunar illumination. Aggregating samples by species and tissue type, Bayesian ecological niche modeling identified a 53.14\%--54.15\% and 78.02\%--97.08\% probability of niche overlap from fin clip and white muscle, respectively, whereas limited stomach content data indicated a preference for piscivorous prey. Variability in niche breadth between years suggests these species may exploit a range of prey items over time. These findings indicate that although these two species perform a similar ecological role by feeding on prey occupying the same trophic levels, subtle differences in movement behaviors between them suggest a one-rule-fits-all management approach is not likely the most effective option.},

@article{oppel15,
	abstract = {Many animals reproduce in large aggregations, which can vary in size from dozens to millions of individuals across species, time and space. The size of breeding colonies is a complex trade-off between multiple costs and benefits to an individual's fitness, but the mechanisms by which colony size affects fitness are still poorly understood. One important cost of breeding in a large colony is the spatial constraint in resource use due to the need to regularly return to a central location. Large aggregations, like seabird breeding colonies, may therefore deplete food resources near the colony, forcing individuals to travel farther to find food, which may ultimately limit their reproductive output and population size. This hypothesis, proposed in 1963 by Ashmole for tropical oceanic islands, has so far not been tested at tropical seabird colonies, where food availability is less predictable than in colder waters. We compare the foraging distribution of a common tropical seabird, the masked booby Sula dactylatra, breeding on two islands in the South Atlantic that differ in the size of the breeding seabird community by 2 orders of magnitude, but are surrounded by similar oligotrophic waters. Foraging trips from the island with the smaller colony were on average 221 km (61 {\%}) and 18.0 h (75 {\%}) shorter because birds from the smaller colony rarely spent the night at sea and foraged on average 64 km (46 {\%}) closer to the colony. Energy expenditure was significantly lower, and nest survival higher (47 vs. 37 {\%}, n = 371) on the island with the smaller colony. These results are fully consistent with the predictions from Ashmole's hypothesis and indicate that competition for food around tropical oceanic seabird colonies may indeed be a limiting factor for populations. Identifying important feeding areas for seabirds based on their foraging range may need to account for colony size of both the target and potential competitor species.},

The extraordinary abundance of blackfish, Melichlhys niger, and the aggressive nature of moray eels, Lycodontis moringa, towards man are briefly mentioned. The number of species recorded is low for a tropical island and seems to reflect Ascension's geographical isolation and lack of habitat diversity; 15·7\% of Ascension shore fishes (excluding one fish not identified to species level) appear to be endemic to the island, with a further 17·1\% known only from Ascension and St Helena; 30·0\% are recorded only from the western and central Atlantic, while 7·1\% are recorded from the eastern and central Atlantic; 30·0\% are widespread Atlantic species. Two new species are described: Taenioconger camelopardalis and Helcogramma ascensionis.},

	abstract = {Large Procellariiformes (albatrosses and petrels) constitute a highly threatened group of birds, for which bycatch in fisheries is the most prevalent threat. At-sea intentional killing and post-capture, handling-related injuries, remain poorly understood menaces. Here, we report fishermen off southern Brazil trying to reduce bait depredation in pole-and-line and handlining fisheries by hitting birds with a metal piece attached to a pole-and-line on four occasions. Fishermen also mutilated or killed birds caught alive on the lines (aggressive handling). In addition, we present a compilation of records of Procellariiformes with bill mutilations across the southwest Atlantic Ocean. Related to the intentional killing events, 16 birds of four species (two globally threatened) were recorded dead (n = 13) or injured (n = 3) with head trauma, broken limbs, wounds or bill mutilation. Observations spanning 1999--2019 across the waters of Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina totalize 46 Procellariiformes of eight species (four globally threatened) recorded with bill mutilations (29 alive and 17 dead). Mutilations were likely caused by aggressive handling of birds caught alive, potentially in Brazilian hook-and-line fisheries or in demersal and pelagic longline fisheries across the southwest Atlantic. Observations of deliberate killing from multiple vessels and the recurrent records of mutilated birds suggest those practices represent pervasive but largely undocumented threats to seabirds and could complicate the detection of fishery-related population effects. Coordinated actions by international bodies and national authorities are urgently needed to address this threat, including increasing at-sea observation, enforcement actions and campaigns targeting better handling practices among fishermen.},

	abstract = {The decline of populations of certain seabirds and sea turtles around the world is partly related to their incidental capture in large-scale fisheries. However, the impacts of small-scale fisheries on endangered seabirds and sea turtles, being carried out in many places around the world, have been largely neglected by scientists and governments. We monitored 178 fishing days and described a range of poorly known hook-and-line commercial fisheries carried out by the Itaipava fleet, southeastern Brazil, composed by 497 vessels and deploying hooks from 18$\,^{\circ}$S to 35$\,^{\circ}$S. Seven fisheries were defined: fast trolling for tuna and tuna-like species, slow trolling for Bigeye tuna, handlining, surface longline for Dolphinfish, pelagic longline for Swordfish, bottom dropline, and pole-and-line with live bait. We observed bycatch of 47 seabirds of six species and 45 turtles of four species. Capture rates were higher for the surface longline for Dolphinfish (0.15 birds/1000 hooks and 1.08 turtles/1000 hooks), slow trolling for Bigeye tuna (0.41 birds/day) and handlining targeting Yellowfin tuna (0.61 birds/day). Endangered Spectacled petrel (Procellaria conspicillata), Atlantic Yellow-nosed (Thalassarche chlororhynchos), and Black-browed (T. melanophris) albatrosses were the main seabirds caught. Immature Loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) and immature or adult Leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) were the main sea turtles affected by the surface longline for Dolphinfish. Monitoring the fleet and bycatch levels, development of mitigation measures, establishment of educational programs, government control over the fleet, and enforcement, are urgently required for the hook-and-line fisheries described in the present study.},

	abstract = {The incidental capture in fisheries is probably the main conservation problem affecting seabirds. While the capture of albatrosses and petrels on longline hooks is well-known worldwide, the bycatch of diving seabirds in gillnets is an overlooked conservation problem. During a winter coastal fishing trip, the capture of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) was recorded in driftnet and bottom setnet fisheries for the first time in southern Brazil. The highest captures rates were found in driftnets, from 146.5 to 545.5penguins/km2 of net and a total of 56 dead penguins were recorded. In the bottom gillnet, a total of 12 birds were killed and the capture rates varied from 41.7 to 125.0penguins/km2 of net. Although preliminary, the results presented in this paper were consistent between sets. If we consider the magnitude of driftnet and setnet fishing fleets, and that most dead penguins were adults, the impact upon Magellanic penguin populations is probably significant.},

	abstract = {Cetaceans are considered environmental sentinels and their health often reflects either anthropogenic or natural spatio-temporal disturbances. This study investigated the pathological findings and mortality of small cetaceans with the aim of detecting hazards and monitoring health trends in a high-biodiversity area. Between 2007 and 2012, 218 stranded cetaceans were recorded on the Paran{\'a} coast, southern Brazil. Fifty-seven (26.1%) of these animals, including 50 Sotalia guianensis, 2 Pontoporia blainvillei, 2 Stenella frontalis, 1 Stenella longirostris, 1 Tursiops truncatus and 1 Globicephala melas were necropsied and samples were collected for histopathology. Causes of death were determined in 46 of the 57 (80.7%) animals and most (30 or 65.2%) were ascribed to anthropogenic activities, including fisheries bycatch (28/30) and trauma (2/30). The remaining 16 fatalities were considered natural, and attributed to pneumonia (10/16), emaciation (3/16), septicemia (1/16), neonatal pathology (1/16) and choking via food obstruction (1/16). Irrespective of the cause, bronchointerstitial pneumonia, associated with parasitism, lymphadenitis and membranous glomerulonephritis were common findings among all fatalities. These results suggest, that while anthropogenic activities are a leading cause of cetacean strandings in Paran{\'a}, underlying pre-existing diseases may contribute towards deaths. Although the studied area is considered a biosphere reserve by UNESCO, complex anthropogenic and natural interactions might be occurring, increasing cetacean susceptibility to hazards. This study may help facilitate developing an effective conservation plan for coastal cetaceans focusing on reducing fisheries interactions, habitat degradation and pollution as mechanisms for ultimately increasing species resilience.},

	abstract = {Abstract Franciscana dolphin Pontoporia blainvillei bycatch has been high for near six decades in western South Atlantic, with large regional variation. In 2012, the Brazilian Government-regulated gillnet fisheries in south and southeast Brazil by reducing fishing effort and establishing no-fishing zones. However, there is evidence that the magnitude of franciscana bycatch remains high and unsustainable. The aims of this study were to identify hotspot areas of franciscana bycatch associated with two main gillnet fisheries and to propose no-fishing zones combined with limited total allowable fishing effort (i.e. total net length per season) in order to meet management objectives in southern Brazil. A hierarchical Bayesian model using integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) was employed based on 1427 reported settings from 1999 to 2003 and 2006 to 2009. Hotspot zones were detected and are proposed as no-fishing zone during the white croaker Micropogonias furnieri and striped weakfish Cynoscion guatucupa gillnet fishing seasons. Their extents represent 6\% (1466.8 km2) and 19\% (4493.7 km2) of the fishing ground (23 204.1 km2) during croaker and weakfish fishing seasons respectively. The total allowable fishing effort estimated outside the no-fishing zones were estimated at 541 km (95\% credible interval (CrI) [339; 940]) during croaker and 688 km (CrI [312; 2,166]) during weakfish fishing seasons, one order of magnitude lower than the current total fishing effort. The drastic reduction of total fishing effort estimated in this study is largely due to weak protection measures since the gillnet fisheries became the major conservation concern for franciscana by the end of 1970s in southern Brazil. Although the implementation of the proposed exclusion zones and limiting fishing effort will strongly impact the status quo, they were based on the best scientific evidence and on a clearly defined management goal to reduce the risk of the franciscana population's collapse in southern Brazil.},

	abstractnote = {Bycatch of franciscanas in fishing operations along the western South Atlantic Ocean has been observed for approximately 60 years. Reports on bycatch in shark gillnet fisheries off Uruguay date back to the early 1940s. A decade later, gillnet fisheries for bottom-dwelling fish became the major conservation concern for franciscanas in both Brazil and Argentina. A small portion (c. 10%), of the coastal gillnet fleet which operate from the port of Rio Grande (southern Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil) was monitored in 1999-2000. The total annual bycatch was estimated to be 946 franciscanas (non-parametric CI = 467 - 1525) for the year 1999 and 719 (non-parametric CI = CI: 248 - 1413) dolphins for 2000. The total bycatch for the whole FMA III was 1106 (CI: 578 - 1915) for 1999 and 992 (CI: 475 - 1832) for 2000. Since data were not normally distributed confidence intervals were estimated by non-parametric bootstrap. Despite strong evidence of decline for the stock from FMA III, no mitigation strategy has been established or designed. Instead, fishing effort is still very high, it is increasing and bycatch is uncontrolled. Thus, prompt management action is required. Regulation of gillnet fishing effort might be the only suitable immediate action to mitigate the bycatch.},

@article{fogliarini19,
	abstract = {Abstract Bycatch in gillnet fisheries is one of the main threats to several penguin species. Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) are caught by gillnets during their wintering in southern Brazil. However, current information is based only on a small number of sets observed during a single fishing trip. This study assesses bycatch rates of bottom and drift gillnets operating in southern Brazil, and describes the sex and age classes of individuals captured. In 80 bottom gillnet sets, 33 penguins were captured (85\% adults), 14 were sexed of which 13 were females. In 41 drift gillnet sets, four penguins were captured, three of which were juveniles. The mean bycatch rates, measured as number of penguins km−2 of net and number of penguins km−2 h−1, were significantly higher for the drift gillnets. Despite the lower bycatch rates, owing to the higher fishing effort in terms of number of boats, net length, net area, soak time and fishing season, the magnitude of penguin bycatch in the bottom gillnet fishery cannot be ignored. Despite based on small sample size, the predominance of adult and female Magellanic penguins as bycatch in gillnet fisheries in southern Brazil agrees with previous studies suggesting that females displace further north than males. In addition, such evidence contributes to the male-biased sex ratio in breeding grounds, and the long-term decline of major Patagonian colonies owing to higher female mortality during winter.},

	abstract = {Tropical and subtropical shrimp fisheries occur mainly nearshore, where numerous non-target species (bycatch) are captured. Bycatch is a serious issue for fishing activity and understanding its impacts through integrative analyses of the bycatch structure is necessary. In Brazil, information on bycatch composition and structure is limited. As such, we conducted a study on the target species and bycatch communities from a fishery area in the southern Brazilian coast, considering a 20-year dataset. The target species abundance was influenced by seasonal conditions, where peaks of abundance occurred from February to May and August to October. The trawl captures comprised 149 species, of which 116 species were discarded and 33 were considered usable by the fishermen. The bycatch composition had few abundant and several rare species, with a high bycatch rate associated with salinity and TSS, mainly in the latter years of study. Bycatch diversity showed association with salinity, and multiyear oscillations, but generally maintained a stable trend over years. Our analysis revealed bycatch patterns and the influence of environmental variables in a single ecosystem. In the context of scarce data and an incipient management structure, these findings are crucial to develop a coherent approach for fisheries management.},

	abstract = {{In response to concerns over wastage and negative impacts on stocks, the damage (antennae loss) and collateral mortality of artisanally trawled-and-discarded juvenile seabob shrimp (Xiphopenaeus kroyeri) and the key factors explaining variability were assessed in the South Brazil Bight. During 20 deployments across 7 d of fishing, 1562 X. kroyeri (14.5 $\pm$ 3.1 mm carapace length, CL) were discarded into replicate on-board tanks at both the start and end of sorting, with some individuals monitored immediately for antennae loss and mortalities, and the rest assessed after 3 h. Virtually, all X. kroyeri discarded towards the end of sorting (mean $\pm$ SD air exposure of 15.9 $\pm$ 3.9 min) died. By comparison, those discarded at the start (2.7 $\pm$ 2.8 min) had variable temporal mortalities (total of 52.3\\% immediately vs. 66.2\\% after 3 h) which, like antennae loss (total mean $\pm$ SE of 50.4 $\pm$ 34.2\\%) were positively associated with haul duration/catch weight and deck exposure, and more frequent among individuals with soft than hard exoskeletons. Antennae loss was also negatively correlated with CL. The results support (i) improving trawl selectivity to reduce the catches of small, unwanted X. kroyeri and other bycatch (and therefore total weights of catches) and/or (ii) sorting catches in water (to minimize air exposure). Such modifications might be promoted through awareness of the potential harvest benefits to fishers associated with reducing unaccounted fishing mortality of the targeted species.}},

	abstract = {Ecosystem effects of recent changes in fishing strategies in the South Brazil Bight (SBB) area, including increasing squid catches by shrimp bottom trawlers and fishing for young sardines as bait, for the skipjack tuna pole-and-line fishery were investigated by modelling the SBB coastal ecosystem for the 1998--1999 fisheries period, using the mass-balance modelling software, Ecopath with Ecosim. Based on fisheries information and on previous models, 25 species groups were defined. The mean trophic level of all fisheries was 2.99 with small trawlers and the live baitfish fleet occupying the lowest trophic levels. The change in squid fishing rate and the most important squid predators fishing rate were simulated by increasing fishing mortality (F) from 0 to 1 per year, while maintaining F constant for other exploited groups. Also, the impact of fishing pressure by trawlers on squids and by the live baitfish fleet on young sardines were simulated. Different hypotheses of flow control were tested by setting the maximum instantaneous mortality rate that consumers could exert on food resources by (a) ``top-down'' control by predators (predator control); (b) all interactions of mixed control type; and (c) ``bottom-up'' control of predators by their prey (donor control). For squid, predicted biomass changes were more pronounced under top-down control that under bottom-up. Biomass of the weakfish, which are important squid predators, were the most affected under all hypotheses. A similar pattern of decrease in other squid predators was seen. The ecosystem consequence of overexploiting weakfish and large pelagic fish biomass was speculated regarding the increasing squid catches. Simulations of increasing live-baitfish fleet did not show prominent impact in the inner shelf, where present F values are low. Given young sardines concentrate in shallow waters, where the conflicts converge, a complementary model of the adjacent coastal system and artisanal fisheries could better address fleet's impact. Nevertheless, it was noted a decrease of sharks and rays reflecting their vulnerability in the system. A precautionary measure for fisheries management in the region would be to assume that top-down control is a dominant force in energy flows, differing from the custom emphasis placed only in environmental forces and productivity. The ecosystem approach will require the integration of information from a wide range of disciplines, levels of ecological organization and temporal and spatial scales, as well as concrete management measures.},

	abstract = {Landing data are the most basic information used to manage fisheries, although they are often unavailable or incomplete. The objective of this work was to reconstruct the national database of marine commercial landings for the Brazilian industrial and artisanal fisheries, from 1950 to 2015. Total landings increased strongly from 1950 to mid-1980s and suffered sharp decline in the early 1990s, mainly associated to the collapse of sardine fisheries. After that, another period of increasing landings was observed, but at a much lower rate. Industrial landings always surpassed artisanal landings in Brazilian waters, except for the beginning of the time series, when many industrial fleets had not started yet, and in the early 2000s, when a change in the methodology for collecting landing statistics was implemented in the state of Par{\'a} leading to an overestimation of artisanal landings. Artisanal fisheries have been declining since 2005, which is worrisome due to the social impact it may have on local income and food security. Regional differences were also observed, with industrial landings being always higher than artisanal landings in southeastern-southern Brazil, while the opposite was true for the northern-northeastern regions. Higher landings were observed in the southeastern-southern regions when both artisanal and industrial fleets were combined. Sardine and demersal fishes were the main resources landed by industrial fishers. Artisanal fishers caught more species than their industrial counterpart, featuring Xiphopenaeus kroyeri, Cynoscion acoupa, and Ucides cordatus. Although the fishing of Epinephelus itajara was banned in Brazil, it continues to be landed. Yet, catches of this species and others under some threat status are still not properly registered, including: Carcharhinus longimanus, Galeorhinus galeus, Sphyrna lewini, Sphyrna mokarran, Pristis pectinata, and Pseudobatos horkelii. Fishing resources not identified in previous landing reconstruction efforts, such as sea urchins and sea cucumbers, have now been reported. The database presented here should be continuously updated and improved. It is of paramount importance to resume the collection of landing statistics, including information on fishing effort, to assess the relative impact of fisheries and environmental factors on the main Brazilian fishing stocks.},

	abstract = {Large pelagic predators occupy high positions in food webs and could control lower trophic level species by direct and indirect ecological interactions. In this study we aimed to test the hypotheses: (1) pelagic predators are keystone species, and their removals could trigger impacts on the food chain; (2) higher landings of pelagic predators could trigger fishing impacts with time leading to a drop in the mean trophic level of catches; and (3) recovery in the pelagic predators populations, especially for sharks, could be achieved with fishing effort reduction. We performed a food web approach using an Ecopath with Ecosim model to represent the Southeastern and Southern Brazil, a subtropical marine ecosystem, in 2001. We then calibrated the baseline model using catch and fishing effort time series from 2001 to 2012. Afterwards, we simulated the impact of fishing effort changes on species and assessed the ecological impacts on the pelagic community from 2012 to 2025. Results showed that the model was well fitted to landing data for the majority of groups. The pelagic predators species were classified as keystone species impacting mainly on pelagic community. The ecosystem was resilient and fisheries seem sustainable at that time. However, the temporal simulation, from 2001 to 2012, revealed declines in the biomass of three sharks, tuna and billfish groups. It was possible observe declines in the mean trophic level of the catch and in the mean total length of landings. Longline fisheries particularly affected the sharks, billfish and swordfish, while hammerhead sharks were mostly impacted by gillnet fishery. Model simulations showed that large sharks'biomasses could be recovered or maintained only after strong fishing effort reduction.},

	abstract = {Skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) is one of the world's main fisheries resources. In Brazil, it is the most abundant tuna and sustains an important pole-and-line fishery in the southwest Atlantic. We systematically monitored landings of the pole-and-line fleet from January 2014 to May 2016 on fishing ports in Niter{\'o}i (RJ) to evaluate the size structure of the catches, identify species reproductive patterns and to estimate growth, recruitment and mortality parameters on the southeastern Brazilian coast. Captured specimens of K. pelamis (n = 5650) ranged from 36.5 to 84.7 cm (fork length-FL, mean = 52.0 cm $\pm$ 7.0) and from 0.9 to 15.3 kg (total weight-TW, mean = 3.1 kg $\pm$ 1.6). There was a modal progression of sizes throughout the austral seasons, with smallest individuals entering in the spring, and larger individuals in the fall. The sex ratio was 1:1 (M:F), and reproductive indices indicated a period of greater reproductive activity between the spring and early summer, with spawning peaks in January. The length at maturity was estimated at 45.6 cm FL. The estimated von Bertalanffy growth parameters were L∞ = 90.1 cm; k = 0.24 year−1; t0 = −0.54. Recruitment into the fishery occurs between 2 and 3 years of age. The total mortality, fishing mortality, natural mortality and exploitation rate were estimated at 1.42 year−1, 0.95 year−1, 0.47 year-1 and 0.67, respectively. Our results demonstrate changes in population parameters of skipjack tuna captured in southeastern Brazil. The reduction in the size structure of the fisheries, anticipation of length of first sexual maturation, small increase in the growth rate and the 30% increase in the exploitation rate indicate that, after 30 years of intense fishing activity, the Western Atlantic stock is under a high fishing pressure and must be monitored closely.},

Brazilian sardine (Sardinella brasiliensis Steindachner, 1879) spawning and nursery habitats: spatial-scale partitioning and multiscale relationships with thermohaline descriptors. -- ICES Journal of Marine Science, 69: 939--952.We provide a detailed account of the spatial structure of the Brazilian sardine (Sardinella brasiliensis) spawning and nursery habitats, using ichthyoplankton data from nine surveys (1976--1993) covering the Southeastern Brazilian Bight (SBB). The spatial variability of sardine eggs and larvae was partitioned into predefined spatial-scale classes (broad scale, 200--500 km; medium scale, 50--100 km; and local scale, \\&lt;50 km). The relationship between density distributions at both developmental stages and environmental descriptors (temperature and salinity) was also explored within these spatial scales. Spatial distributions of sardine eggs were mostly structured on medium and local scales, while larvae were characterized by broad- and medium-scale distributions. Broad- and medium-scale surface temperatures were positively correlated with sardine densities, for both developmental stages. Correlations with salinity were predominantly negative and concentrated on a medium scale. Broad-scale structuring might be explained by mesoscale processes, such as pulsing upwelling events and Brazil Current meandering at the northern portion of the SBB, while medium-scale relationships may be associated with local estuarine outflows. The results indicate that processes favouring vertical stability might regulate the spatial extensions of suitable spawning and nursery habitats for the Brazilian sardine.}},
